Welcome to the start of Branches.
In here, I will post things I want to put inside here, and Create a lot of files.
So, it is recommended to read them in order.
Sometimes, I create other paths that I will work with while doing the main path.
Oh, I feel it,
this is going to be very tedious.
It is basiccally a journal but not a journal.
So, what will I write in the next file?
I don't know.
How many branches will there be?
Most likely making one when I want to, but still,
I don't know.
This is a project made by me.
And... that's all I have to say.
See you in the next file.
